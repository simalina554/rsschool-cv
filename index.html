<b>Mental disorder</b> is broadly defined as a mental condition that differs from normal, healthy conditions. There is a more specific meaning of the term in fields such as law, psychiatry, and psychology.

The opposite of mental illness is mental health. People who are able to adjust to life's conditions and solve life's problems are usually evaluated as mentally healthy. If, however, these abilities are limited and the person is unable to cope with the daily tasks of personal, family life or work when they are unable to achieve personal goals, then some degree of mental disorder may be involved.

Mental distress entails changes and disturbances in feelings, thinking, and behavior, and along with this, according to some claims, there are almost always changes in the somatic functions of the body. Creation of successful psychological and drug treatments is possible with the cooperation of medicine and psychology and consideration of mental disorders from different perspectives.

According to the WHO, one in four to five people in the world has a mental or behavioral disorder. The causes of many mental disorders are not fully understood. There are a number of signs and symptoms that experts recommend seeking professional help.

The identification of the concepts "mental disorder" and "mental illness" is criticized, because in psychiatry it is difficult to apply the main criteria of illness (biological - presence of bodily pathology, medical - quality of life and threat to life, social - impairment of social functioning of a person). Often, it is only assumed that bodily dysfunction is at the root of a particular mental disorder. In this regard, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) uses the term "mental disorder" instead of the terms "mental illness" or "mental disease".

<div class='container-fluid' id='schizophrenia'>
<p>
<b>Schizophrenia</b> is an endogenous polymorphous mental disorder (or group of mental disorders) characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and emotional reactions.

Schizophrenic disorders, in general, are characterized by characteristic fundamental disturbances in thinking and perception, as well as inadequate or reduced affect. The most frequent manifestations of the disease are auditory pseudohallucinations, confabulations (false memories), paranoid or fantastical delusions or disorganized speech and thinking against a background of significant social dysfunction and impaired performance.

The overall risk of the disease, according to studies, is 0.4-0.6% (4-6 cases per 1,000 people). Men and women have about the same rate of illness, but women tend to have a later onset.

When treating schizophrenia, medication therapy with antipsychotics along with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, family psychotherapy, occupational therapy, and social rehabilitation are the main treatments. It remains unclear which antipsychotics are more effective, typical or atypical, yet the latter are more modern and have fewer side effects. In severe cases and among those for whom other antipsychotics do not help, clozapine is used, which has been shown in studies to be the most effective. If it does not work, it is recommended that another antipsychotic or antidepressant be added to it.

Schizophrenia is one of the main causes of disability. A study of 14 countries in 1999 showed that the condition of active psychosis ranks third in this regard after total paralysis and dementia, surpassing paraplegia and blindness in terms of disabling effects.

In a severe course of the disease, if the patient poses a risk to himself or herself and others, involuntary hospitalization may be required. However, in Western Europe, the frequency and duration of hospitalization has decreased, and the quality of social services has improved.

Anosognosia, the individual's lack of awareness that he or she is ill, can be seen in schizophrenia. Doctors sometimes have to deal with denial of the disease not only by the schizophrenic patient himself, but also by his close relatives, which occurs even among fairly educated people.

<div class='container-fluid' id='Depression'><p><img src="71bd9670148764b7736460da61c601e5.jpg" class="float-end" width='200' height='200'>
<b>Depression</b> is a mental disorder, the main signs of which are a decreased - depressed, depressed, sad, anxious, fearful or indifferent - mood and a decreased or lost capacity for pleasure. Some of the following symptoms are also usually present: decreased self-esteem, loss of interest in life and familiar activities, inadequate feelings of guilt, pessimism, impaired concentration, fatigue or lack of energy, sleep and appetite disorders, and suicidal tendencies. Severe forms of depression are characterized by the so-called "depressive triad": a decrease in mood, lethargy of thinking and motor lethargy.

Depressed mood in some cases can be a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one. Depression can be a symptom of certain somatic diseases and a side effect of certain medications and treatments; when the cause of depression is not obvious and the depressive disorder occurs without external influences, such depression is called endogenous. In some cases, a person suffering from depression may begin to abuse substances.

It is a type of affective disorder (mood disorder). Depression is treatable, but depression is currently the most common mental disorder.

<div class='container-fluid'id='Bipolar'><p>
<b>Bipolar</b> disorder is an endogenous mental disorder that manifests as affective states: manic and depressive, and often mixed states. Multiple variants of mixed states are possible.

These affective states, called episodes or phases of the disorder, periodically alternate with each other almost without influence of external circumstances (i.e. "endogenously"), directly or through "light" intervals of mental health (intermissions, also called interphases), without or almost without reduction of mental functions, even with a large number of phases suffered and any duration of illness. In intermissions, the patient's psyche and personality are fully restored. Patients with bipolar disorder often suffer from other, concomitant mental disorders as well.

Treatment of bipolar disorders is challenging because it requires a detailed understanding of psychopharmacology. Patients with bipolar disorder often take several highly potent medications (some patients take up to six medications simultaneously), which creates difficulties in accounting for drug interactions and in preventing side effects.
</p></div>

<div class='container-fluid'id='Panicattack'><p>
<b>A panic attack</b> is a sudden, often gratuitous attack of severe anxiety accompanied by excruciating sensations. PA is characterized by a rapid increase in fear and, in most cases, by short duration. The condition is usually accompanied by various fears, such as fear of death, fear of going mad or losing control of oneself. Also, patients suffering from PA often perceive panic attack symptoms as a manifestation of dangerous illnesses (e.g., myocardial infarction or stroke). These disturbing thoughts increase the panic state.

Panic attacks can also occur during sleep, in which case the patient wakes up in a state of excruciating fear.

Panic attacks are a major manifestation of panic disorder, but panic disorder does not occur in all panic patients. Panic disorder is characterized by frequent panic attacks that are not caused by any external cause. In addition, in panic disorder, the patient experiences fear not only during the attacks, but also at the thought that an attack may occur. This kind of fear may be present all the time. Finally, panic disorder is characterized by the patient's desire to avoid anything that can cause a panic attack.

Symptoms during an attack are uncontrollable, it greatly demoralizes the person and causes a sense of powerlessness and despair. The person's desire to consciously control their condition during a panic attack makes the symptoms even more intense. Often the anticipation of a possible attack is more excruciating than the attack itself. The person fears in advance that he or she won't be able to cope with the panic attack or won't be able to get help. For this reason, many patients begin to avoid situations in which an attack may occur (for example, staying alone or leaving the house).

Panic attacks can occur in disorders other than panic disorder, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder.

Psychotherapy and medications may be used to treat panic attacks. There are also methods of alternative medicine to reduce generalized anxiety, but at the moment, their effectiveness has not been proven. For the prevention of panic attacks, a healthy lifestyle, physical activity, methods aimed at reducing anxiety and the exclusion of factors that can cause excessive agitation are recommended.

<b>Eating disorders</b> are a class of psychogenically induced behavioral syndromes associated with eating disorders. Eating disorders include, among others, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, psychogenic overeating, as well as a number of other disorders. Eating disorders refer to mental disorders.

Eating disorders refer to psychologically determined disorders of eating behavior. It is a whole group of syndromes in the ICD-10 with widely varying content: from anorexia nervosa, often leading to death, to overeating that can spontaneously stop.

This group includes, in particular, overeating, which leads to overweight and is a reaction to distress. Such "reactive obesity" can follow the loss of loved ones, accidents, surgery, and emotional distress, especially in persons predisposed to obesity.

Being overweight as a cause but not a consequence of psychological disorders does not apply to eating disorders, although it may condition an individual's sensitivity about his or her appearance and contribute to a loss of confidence in interpersonal relationships, and subjective assessments of body size may be exaggerated. Being overweight as a cause of psychological disturbances is classified in ICD-10 groups such as F38 ("Other mood disorders"), F41.2 ("Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder") or F48.9 ("Unspecified neurotic disorder"), combined with one of the group codes E66 ("Obesity") to indicate the type of obesity.

<div class='container-fluid' id='Neurosis'><p>
<b>Neurosis, psychoneurosis, neurotic disorder</b> is an obsolete name for a group of neuropsychiatric disorders arising from acute and chronic psychological trauma and characterized by a lack of qualitative changes in mental activity. The clinical picture of such disorders is characterized by asthenic, obsessive or hysterical manifestations and a temporary decrease in mental and physical work capacity.

The psychogenic factor in all cases is conflicts, the influence of circumstances which cause psychological trauma, stress, or prolonged overstrain of the emotional and intellectual spheres of the psyche.

The term "neurosis" was introduced into medicine in 1776 by the Scottish physician William Cullen. The content of the term has been repeatedly revised; there is no unambiguous, generally accepted definition of the term to this day. It should also be borne in mind that in medicine and biology, "neurosis" may refer to various functional disorders of higher nervous activity.

Mental disorders have traditionally been differentiated into neuroses and psychoses. Unlike psychotic disorders, in neuroses people are critical of their disorder and are able to direct their actions.

<div class='container-fluid' id='Dementia'><p>
<b>Dementia</b> is acquired dementia, a persistent decline in cognitive activity with the loss, to varying degrees, of previously learned knowledge and practical skills and difficulty or inability to acquire new ones. Unlike mental retardation (formerly - oligophrenia), which is a mental underdevelopment, dementia is a breakdown of mental functions that occurs as a result of disease or damage to the brain after the completion of its maturation. Dementia is most commonly seen in old age. In popular parlance, senile dementia is called senile marasmus. According to the WHO, in 2015, there were more than 46 million people with dementia worldwide.

<div class='container-fluid' id='Phobia'><p>
<b>Phobia</b>, fear is a symptom, the essence of which is an irrational uncontrollable fear or persistent experience of excessive anxiety in certain situations or in the presence (expectation) of some known object.

Phobia usually results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person goes to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, to an extent that exceeds the actual danger. If the dangerous object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person experiences considerable distress. When there is a phobia of blood or trauma, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. It is common for a person to have phobias about a number of objects or situations.

Phobias can be divided into specific phobias, social phobia (sociophobia), and agoraphobia. Types of specific phobias include those that relate to certain animals, natural environmental conditions, blood or injury, and specific situations. Fear of spiders, snakes and heights are the most common. Sometimes the phobia occurs after a stressful situation involving some object of fear. In social phobia, a person is afraid of a situation because he or she worries that others may judge him or her. Agoraphobia - fear of open space, open doors; mental disorder in which there is a fear of crowds of people who may require unexpected action; unconscious fear experienced when walking without an escort in a large square or deserted street.

Specific phobias are recommended to be treated with contact therapy, in which the person is introduced to the situation or object of fear until the fear passes. Medications are useless for this type of phobia. Social phobia and agoraphobia are often treated with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Medications used include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers.

Specific phobias affect about 6-8% of people in the Western world and 2-4% of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Social phobia affects about 7% of people in the United States and 0.5-2.5% of people in the rest of the world. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of people. Women are affected about twice as often as men. The disease usually occurs between the ages of 10 and 17. The number of patients decreases with age. People with phobias are at higher risk of suicide than people who do not suffer from phobias.

<div class='container-fluid' id='addiction'><p><img src="teen_psychosis.jpg" class="" align='right' width='250' height='150'>
<b>Addiction</b> is a compulsive urge to regularly use drugs or pleasure-inducing drugs to achieve the relief, comfort, excitement, or fun they cause; often with addiction to opiates, barbiturates, and morphine-like substances, and possibly alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, and phenamine, a craving to take such a drug in the absence of such a drug, the existence of marked somatic dependence in addiction to opiates and morphine-like analgesics, barbiturates and possibly phenamine and alcohol, the presence of increased tolerance (or adaptation) to opiates and morphine-like analgesics, barbiturates and possibly phenamine and alcohol psychotoxic effects usually occur during withdrawal reactions when addicted to opiates, morphine-like analgesics, barbiturates, and alcohol. The ICD-9 suggests replacing the term "addiction" with the term "dependence". 
</p></div>

<div class='container-fluid' id='psichos'><p>
 <b>Psychosis</b> is an imprecise term coined by von Feich-Terschleben in 1846, which has since been used for a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by severe impairment of mental functions, due to impaired psychological contact with reality and usually antisocial behavior. Disorders of consciousness, memory, mood, thinking or psychomotor behavior are the most pronounced clinical symptoms, which depend on the nature of the psychosis; criticism is often severely impaired. The adjective "psychotic" is often used in a purely descriptive sense, indicating the presence of certain symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder. In terms of etiology, psychoses are usually subdivided into those that are a component of a somatic illness affecting cerebral functions and those that have a nondeterministic structure or metabolic pathology.
