<b>Depression</b> is a mental disorder, the main signs of which are a decreased - depressed, depressed, sad, anxious, fearful or indifferent - mood and a decreased or lost capacity for pleasure. Some of the following symptoms are also usually present: decreased self-esteem, loss of interest in life and familiar activities, inadequate feelings of guilt, pessimism, impaired concentration, fatigue or lack of energy, sleep and appetite disorders, and suicidal tendencies. Severe forms of depression are characterized by the so-called "depressive triad": a decrease in mood, lethargy of thinking and motor lethargy.

Depressed mood in some cases can be a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one. Depression can be a symptom of certain somatic diseases and a side effect of certain medications and treatments; when the cause of depression is not obvious and the depressive disorder occurs without external influences, such depression is called endogenous. In some cases, a person suffering from depression may begin to abuse substances.

It is a type of affective disorder (mood disorder). Depression is treatable, but depression is currently the most common mental disorder.

<div class='container-fluid'id='Bipolar'><p>
<b>Bipolar</b> disorder is an endogenous mental disorder that manifests as affective states: manic and depressive, and often mixed states. Multiple variants of mixed states are possible.

These affective states, called episodes or phases of the disorder, periodically alternate with each other almost without influence of external circumstances (i.e. "endogenously"), directly or through "light" intervals of mental health (intermissions, also called interphases), without or almost without reduction of mental functions, even with a large number of phases suffered and any duration of illness. In intermissions, the patient's psyche and personality are fully restored. Patients with bipolar disorder often suffer from other, concomitant mental disorders as well.

Treatment of bipolar disorders is challenging because it requires a detailed understanding of psychopharmacology. Patients with bipolar disorder often take several highly potent medications (some patients take up to six medications simultaneously), which creates difficulties in accounting for drug interactions and in preventing side effects.
